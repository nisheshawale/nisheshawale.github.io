People make fake copies of popular brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and Chanel. The task was to predict whether the bag is real or fake from its images. Different regions of interest were detected using object detection models. Then, another model was used to perform classification.

**Technologies used:** Tensorflow, CometML, YOLOv5, Mask-RCNN and RetinaNet
