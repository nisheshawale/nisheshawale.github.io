I am a machine learning engineer by profession. I received a Bachelor of Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University, graduating *`summa cum laude`* `(university topper)`. I have two years of expertise in developing AI-enabled products with an emphasis on Natural Language Processing as well as Computer Vision. Right now, I am seeking a `research assistant position` to work on natural language processing and machine learning problems.

My primary research interests lie in extracting information in the structured form from documents that are in an unstructured and semi-structured format. I am always looking forward to blending both NLP as well as computer vision techniques in information extraction as well as in AI projects in general. I am also interested in multimodal AI research.

Additionally, I am a member of Sakura Science Club Japan. I possess strong leadership skills with creative problem-solving abilities.

`Research Interests:` Natural Language Processing, Information Extraction and Multimodal AI Research.
