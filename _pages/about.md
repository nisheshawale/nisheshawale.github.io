I am a machine learning engineer by profession. I graduated with *summa cum laude* (as a university topper) from the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University in Bachelors of Electronics and Communication Engineering. I have two years of experience in developing AI enabled products with a focus in Natural Language Processing as well as Computer Vision.

My main research interests lies in extracting information in the structured form from documents that are in an unstructured and semi-structured format. I am always looking forward to blend both NLP as well as computer vision techniques in information extraction as well as in AI projects in general.

I am also a member of Sakura Science Club Japan. I possess strong leadership skills with creative problem solving abilities.
