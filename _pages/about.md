I am Nishesh Awale, a passionate and driven graduate student pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO), USA. Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant under the guidance of <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/about/faculty-staff/jon-youn.php"> Dr. Jon Youn</a>, focusing on pattern recognition using data from triaxial accelerometers. Before joining my graduate studies, I worked as a machine learning engineer for more than three years. I received my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University, graduating *`summa cum laude`* `(1st in class)`. Right now, I am actively seeking an `internship for Summer 2025` in software development, data science or artificial intelligence to further enhance my skills and contribute to innovative projects.

<!-- My primary research interests lie in extracting information in the structured form from documents that are in an unstructured and semi-structured format. I am always looking forward to blending both NLP as well as computer vision techniques in information extraction as well as in AI projects in general. I am also interested in multimodal AI research. -->

Additionally, I am a member of Sakura Science Club, Japan. I possess strong leadership skills with creative problem-solving abilities.

`Interests:` Software Development, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence.
